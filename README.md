# Simile

**Simile** is a Python client library for interacting with your Agent & Population endpoints. It provides a simple interface for creating and managing agents, managing populations, and performing asynchronous tasks such as generating agent responses or creating sub-populations.

## Features

- **Agent Management**: Create, delete, retrieve details for agents.
- **Population Management**: Create populations, add/remove agents, delete, or create sub-populations.
- **Asynchronous Tasks**: Returns a `Task` object that can be polled or waited upon for long-running operations.

## Installation

Install via **pip** (once you've published to PyPI):

```bash
pip install simile
